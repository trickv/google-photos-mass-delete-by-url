A hacky little setup to delete specific Google Photos images by driving Chrome remotely using puppeteer.

I only really use Photos for sharing stuff with family/friends via albums. But sometimes I upload stuff I don't need. I tend to remove it from albums, but don't always delete it, so my photos account is full of stuff that can be deleted.

I was first prompted to do this in 2021/2022 when Google started charging for storage and again worked on these scripts in 2025 when I started to hit the storage limit again.

To use:
- Write something that talks to the Google Photos API and selects out the URLs that you want to delete. I wrote a Google Apps Script which selects out the list of all photos that are in albums, finds the ones that are not in an album, and makes a spreadsheet. Format it and download; just one URL per line as a plain text file.
- Fire up Chrome using the run-chrome script which starts it with a remote control websocket, and make sure it's signed into the Google account that owns the photos. Wait 5 seconds so it can write the web socket URL down.
- Run ./git-er-done <filename> and it'll slowly crawl through your photos deleting them. It might skip files if it thinks they are in an album; there's some rudimentary in-album detection which uses CSS selectors and is pretty conservative and thus not entirely accurate...
